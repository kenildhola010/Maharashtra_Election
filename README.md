## 🔗 Assembly–Parliamentary Mapping (Project Highlight)

A major strength of this project is the integration of Parliamentary election results with Assembly constituency boundaries.

Instead of analyzing elections independently, this dashboard:

* Maps Parliamentary results onto Assembly constituencies
* Creates Assembly-wise Parliamentary performance views
* Compares party dominance across AC and PC elections
* Identifies cross-election strongholds
* Classifies seats as **Kingdom**, **Strong**, or **Change**

### Analytical Approaches Used:

1. **PC with AC Boundary (V1)**
   Parliamentary winning party visualized using Assembly boundaries.

2. **Assembly-wise Parliamentary Model (V2)**
   Parliamentary results transformed and analyzed at Assembly level for deeper comparison.

This cross-election mapping enables strategic insights beyond traditional election dashboards.
